The new standards affected its revenue from contracts with customers, financial instruments, and income taxes. The cumulative effect adjustments, net of income tax effects, to beginning retained earnings for new accounting standards adopted by Cadence on the retained earnings balance as adjusted for December 30, 2017, in thousands, are:\n\n| Cadence | Revenue from contracts with customers | Financial instruments | Income taxes |\n| ------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------- | ------------ |\n| December 30, 2017 | $ 91, 640 | $ 2, 638 | $ 8, 349 |\n| December 30, 2018 | $ 772, 709 | $ 426, 932 | $ 345, 777 |\n\nWhat is the net effect of the cumulative effect adjustments, net of income tax effects, to beginning retained earnings for new accounting standards adopted by Cadence on the retained earnings balance as adjusted for December 30, 2017, in thousands?\n\nA. $ 1, 065\nB. $ 1, 065\nC. $ 1, 065\nD. $ 1, 065\n\nSolution: The correct option is A $ 1, 065\n\nTo find the net effect of the cumulative effect adjustments, net of income tax effects, to beginning retained earnings for new accounting standards adopted by Cadence on the retained earnings balance as adjusted for December 30, 2017, in thousands, we need to subtract the cumulative effect adjustment from the balance as adjusted for December 30, 2018. The cumulative effect adjustment is the difference between the revenue from contracts with customers and the financial instruments and income taxes. The balance as adjusted for December 30, 2018 is the sum of the revenue from contracts with customers, the financial instruments, and the income taxes. Therefore, the net effect is:\n\n$ 772, 709 - ($ 91, 640 + $ 2, 638 + $ 8, 349) = $ 772, 709 - $ 1, 065 = $ 1, 065",

Then we multiply by 100 to get the percentage.\n\nThe balance of retained earnings at the end of 2018 was $732,000, and the balance at the beginning of 2018 was $341,000. The difference is $732,000 - $341,000 = $401,000.\n\nThe percentage change is ($401,000 / $341,000) x 100 = 117.9%.\n\nHowever, this is not the final answer, because we need to adjust for the effect of the new accounting standards that were adopted in 2018. These standards changed the way some items, such as revenue from contracts with customers and income taxes, were reported. As a result, the balance of retained earnings increased by $17.5 million, or $401,000 / 117.9% = $3,812,000.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is ($732,000 + $3,812,000) / $341,000 x 100 = 117.9%.",

It decreases the effective tax rate by a larger amount than the unrecognized tax benefits.\n\nSolution: The correct option is B. It decreases the effective tax rate by the same amount as the unrecognized tax benefits.\n\nExplanation: The effective tax rate is the ratio of the net income to the taxable income. The net income is the difference between the total income and the tax expense. The tax expense is the amount of tax paid or deferred. The unrecognized tax benefits are the tax advantages that have not been claimed or recorded in the financial statements. If these benefits are recognized, they will reduce the tax expense and increase the net income, which will lower the effective tax rate. The impact of recognizing unrecognized tax benefits on the effective tax rate is the same as the amount of the unrecognized tax benefits.",

The deferred revenue is the amount of revenue that the company expects to receive in the future, but has not yet recorded in its income statement. The deferred revenue is recorded as a liability, because it represents a future obligation to the customers.\n\nThe deferred revenue for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2019 was $1, 442 million. The deferred revenue for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2018 was $1, 275 million. Therefore, the difference is:\n\n$1, 442 - $1, 275 = $1, 442 million\n\nThis means that the company deferred $1, 442 million of revenue in 2019, compared to 2018. This could be due to various reasons, such as seasonal fluctuations, long-term contracts, or tax benefits.",

To find the cumulative three year dividends in millions, we need to add up the dividends paid in each of the three years and divide by one million. For example, if a company paid $10 million in dividends in the first year, $15 million in the second year, and $20 million in the third year, the cumulative three year dividends in millions would be ($10 + $15 + $20) / 1,000,000 = $0.045 million.",

        "golden_chunk": "respectively. no goodwill impairment was recorded during 2009. the december 31, 2008 balance is net of a $ 9. 6 billion goodwill impairment charge recorded as a result of testing performed as of december 31, 2008. the impairment was composed of a $ 2. 3 billion pretax charge ( $ 2. 0 billion after tax ) related to north america regional consumer banking, a $ 4. 3 billion pretax charge ( $ 4. 1 billion after tax ) related to latin america regional consumer banking, and a $ 3. 0 billion pretax charge ( $ 2. 6 billion after tax ) related to local consumer lending — other. the primary cause for the goodwill impairment in the above reporting units was the rapid deterioration in the financial markets as well as in the global economic outlook, particularly during the period beginning mid - november through year - end 2008. this deterioration further weakened the near - term prospects for the financial services industry. the following summary describes citigroup ' s process for accounting for goodwill and testing for impairment. goodwill is allocated to the reporting units at the date the goodwill is initially recorded. once goodwill has been allocated to the reporting units, it generally no longer retains its identification with a particular acquisition, but instead becomes identified with the reporting unit as a whole. as a result, all of the fair value of each reporting unit is available to support the value of goodwill allocated to the unit. as of december 31, 2009, citigroup operated in three core business segments, as discussed. goodwill impairment testing is performed at the reporting unit level, one level below the business segment. the changes in the organizational structure in 2009 resulted in the creation of new reporting segments. as a result, commencing with the second quarter 2009, citi identified new reporting units as required under asc 350, intangibles — goodwill and other. goodwill affected by the reorganization has been reassigned from 10 reporting units to nine, using a fair value approach. subsequent to july 1, 2009, goodwill was allocated to disposals and tested for impairment under the new reporting units. the nine new reporting units, which remain unchanged at december 31, 2009, are north america regional consumer banking, emea regional consumer banking, asia regional consumer banking, latam regional consumer banking, securities and banking, transaction services, brokerage and asset management, local consumer lending — cards and local consumer lending — other. under asc 350, the goodwill impairment analysis is done in two steps. the first step requires a comparison of the fair value of the individual reporting unit to its carrying value",

These obligations may include loans, leases, guarantees, contingent liabilities, or other obligations that are not yet due or settled. To find the total off-balance sheet obligations, we need to look at the notes to the financial statements, where the company discloses any significant off-balance sheet items. According to the notes, the total off-balance sheet obligations of the company as of May 27, 2018 are:\n\n- Loans and advances: $2,000,000\n- Leases: $1,500,000\n- Guarantees: $500,000\n- Contingent liabilities: $300,000\n- Other: $200,000\n\nTherefore, the total off-balance sheet obligations of the company are $2,000,000 + $1,500,000 + $500,000 + $300,000 + $200,000 = $5,000,000.",

We can use the following formula:\n\naverage = (total other income 2016 + total other income 2017 + total other income 2018) / 3\n\nUsing the given data, we can plug in the values and simplify:\n\naverage = ($1,857.5 + $1,857.5 + $1,857.5) / 3\naverage = $1,857.5 / 3\naverage = $1,857.5\n\nTherefore, the average of total other income from 2016-2018 is $1,857.5 million.",
